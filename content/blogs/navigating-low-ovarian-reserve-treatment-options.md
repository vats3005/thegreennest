Receiving a diagnosis of low ovarian reserve can feel deeply discouraging. It is completely normal to feel anxious, but at The Green Nest, we want to reassure you right away that this diagnosis is not the end of your fertility journey. Many women with a lower egg count go on to have healthy, beautiful pregnancies.

## What Does Low Ovarian Reserve Actually Mean?

Women are born with a finite number of eggs, and this number naturally decreases over time. Low ovarian reserve (often referred to as diminished ovarian reserve) simply means that the quantity of eggs remaining in your ovaries is lower than expected for your age. We typically diagnose this through a simple blood test that measures your Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels alongside an ultrasound to check your Antral Follicle Count.

## The Good News: Quality Over Quantity

It is absolutely vital to remember a core truth of fertility medicine: it only takes one healthy egg to create a baby. While a low AMH level indicates a lower quantity of eggs, it does not automatically mean the quality of your remaining eggs is poor. Age is often a much better predictor of egg quality than your AMH level.

## Tailored Treatment Options at The Green Nest

A standard, one size fits all approach does not work for low ovarian reserve. Dr. Shilpi Srivastava carefully designs highly customized treatment plans to maximize your chances of success.

- **Customized IVF Protocols:** Standard, high dose IVF medications can sometimes over stress ovaries with a lower reserve. Instead, we frequently utilize mild stimulation or "mini IVF" protocols. This gentler approach focuses on retrieving a few high quality eggs rather than forcing the body to produce a large quantity.
- **Embryo Banking (DuoStim):** To maximize your chances, we may recommend advanced techniques like dual stimulation. This involves two egg retrievals within a single menstrual cycle, allowing us to collect and fertilize as many eggs as possible in a short timeframe to build a healthy reserve of frozen embryos.
- **Donor Egg IVF:** If your ovarian reserve is critically low and other treatments are not viable, IVF using eggs from a healthy, thoroughly screened donor is a wonderful option. This path offers exceptionally high success rates and allows you to experience pregnancy and childbirth.
- **Supportive Care:** Alongside medical treatments, we often discuss specific lifestyle adjustments and targeted supplements, such as CoQ10 or DHEA, to help support your overall ovarian health before starting a cycle.
